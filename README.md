# structy

Welcome to my Structy Repository. This repository keeps track of what I'm studying for technical interviews. It includes not only Structy, but also Leetcode and other algorithms and data structures.  

Currently, I'm working on the Graphs portion of Structy and medium Leetcode problems. The answers are in both Python and JavaScript. I learn one then translate it into another. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out.

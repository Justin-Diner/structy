# structy

Welcome to my Structy Repository. This repository keeps track of what I'm doing to study for technical interviews. It includes not only Structy, but also Leetcode and other coding concepts.  

Currently I'm working on the Graphs portion of Structy and Leetcode medium problems. The answers are in both Python and JavaScript. I learn one then translate it into another. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out.
